    # Example:
    #   # sample typically comes from an ADL file
    #   sample = Stamina::ADL.parse_sample_file('sample.adl')
    #
    #   # let BlueFringe build the smallest dfa

    # Remarks:
    # - Constructor and instance methods of this class are public but not intended 
    #   to be used directly. They are left public for testing purposes only.
    # - Having read the Stamina::Induction::BlueFringe base algorithm may help undertanding
    #   this variant.
    # - This class intensively uses the Stamina::Induction::UnionFind class and 
    #   methods defined in the Stamina::Induction::Commons module which are worth
    #   reading to understand the algorithm implementation.
